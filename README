XYZ has an internal tool to host programming contests in the C and Java languages only.

In our programming contest, a problem statement has two aspects to it -

a. A worded problem -
Like in topcoder.com (please visit their site to see how its done if you are not aware of it), we display a worded algorithmic problem.

It has a function definition to be coded by the User.

b. A text-box to write source code -

A text box with some basic pre-written code (default source code) about the problem statement is provided where the User may write his/her code.

For e.g. a worded problem may be -

" Ram has just learned to code and wants to know how to sort an array of N numbers. Help him.

The function signature would be int sort_arr(int* arr, int n)

"

and the text box will contain the following default source code -
"

#include <stdio.h>

int sort(int* arr, int n){

     // write your code here

}

"

This above information would change if the programming language were Java -

"

public class Sort{

  public int sort(ArrayList arr){

     // write your code here

  }
}

"

Your task -

You are creating an internal tool which would automatically create the default source code seen above, given the information of the problem statement through a user interface.

Let's call the person who would be using this tool to add data as the content_provider.

There would be two sides you would be dealing with -

a. Input side - contains the UI to accept information from the content_provider

File name: input.html

b. Processing side - A PHP script to analyze the input, process it and return data back to the Input side.

File name: backend.php

Inputs -

You will accept the following information through your input form -

1. Name of the function

2. Name of the class (applicable only for Java)

3. Number of input arguments.

Based on the number of input arguments, you shall accept the following information for each argument -
4. Variable name (var_name)

5. Basic data type of the argument (type):
For now, this can only be an "integer". If you are done with this task within the time frame expected, you could add the feature for the "char"  data-type.

6. Dimensionality of the argument (dim):

If dim = 0, it means it is just a basic data-type.

If dim = 1, it means its a 1-D array of the basic data type provided.

If dim = 2, it means its a 1-D array of the basic data type provided.

Assume that dim can only take 3 values: 0,1,2.

Based on these two pieces of information, your interface should generate all possible options that could be used separately for the two possible languages - C and Java.

Note - not all arguments may be applicable in all the languages. You should capture this requirement through a convenient feature in your form.

For e.g., var_name = arr, type = "integer" and dim = 1 for the above example of sorting a list. The suggestions generated should be -

For C:

int* arr   or   int arr[ ]

For Java

int[ ]  arr   or   ArrayList arr  or  Set<Integer> arr

or any other representation which can store a list of numbers.

Based on the suggestions provided by you, the content_provider would select an appropriate suggestion and confirm it and proceed with the same process for the other arguments.

You could use jquery (http://jquery.com/) to provide an intuitive interface for suggestions and their selection. 
If you are okay with AJAX etc. feel free to use it. There's no restriction on the technology.
